/**
 * <p>
 * This operator performs a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This method tries to find the linear
 * combination of features which best separate two or more classes of examples. The resulting
 * combination is then used as a linear classifier. LDA is closely related to ANOVA (analysis of
 * variance) and regression analysis, which also attempt to express one dependent variable as a
 * linear combination of other features or measurements. In the other two methods however, the
 * dependent variable is a numerical quantity, while for LDA it is a categorical variable (i.e. the
 * class label).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * LDA is also closely related to principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis in that
 * both look for linear combinations of variables which best explain the data. LDA explicitly
 * attempts to model the difference between the classes of data. PCA on the other hand does not take
 * into account any difference in class.
 * </p>
