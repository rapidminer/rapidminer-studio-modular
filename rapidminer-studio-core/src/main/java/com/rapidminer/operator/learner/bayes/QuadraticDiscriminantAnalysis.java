 * <p>
 * This operator performs a quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). QDA is closely related to linear
 * discriminant analysis (LDA), where it is assumed that the measurements are normally distributed.
 * Unlike LDA however, in QDA there is no assumption that the covariance of each of the classes is
 * identical.
