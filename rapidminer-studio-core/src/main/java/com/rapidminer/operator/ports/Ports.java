 * A collection of either input or output {@link Port}s (as defined by generic class T). <br/>
 * Instances of this class serve as a factory and register of ports. Ports can be accessed by names
 * or index. Actual behaviour is defined by specialized interfaces {@link InputPorts} and
 * {@link OutputPorts}. <br/>
 * Implementors of operators are encouraged to generate their ports at construction time and keep
 * private references to them, rather than retrieving them via one of the get methods every time
 * they are needed. The GUI will probably use the getter-methods. <br/>
 * 
 * Instances of this class can be observed by the {@link Observer} pattern.
