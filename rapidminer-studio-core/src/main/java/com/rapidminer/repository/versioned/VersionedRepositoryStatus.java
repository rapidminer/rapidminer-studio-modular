	 * each client. However, this state can still happen, albeit indirectly: If the versioned repository is deleted on
	 * RapidMiner AI Hub, and then re-created under the same name again (but with a different encryption key), the
	 * aforementioned problems would occur. Therefore, Studio checks whether the expected encryption context (see {@link
	 * com.rapidminer.tools.encryption.EncryptionProvider}) is the same as the current encryption context, based
	 * on the latest AI Hub information. If they differ, this method will indicate that.
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Attention:</strong> Once this happens, ALL GIT INTERACTIONS ARE DISABLED FOREVER! Otherwise we would
	 * corrupt the history, have merge problems, etc. The only way out of this scenario is to connect with a new
	 * repository in Studio to the versioned repository. Then you can copy the files over from old to new via the Studio
	 * UI, and finally delete this repository.
