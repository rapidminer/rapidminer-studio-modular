/**
 * A builder for creating {@link RepositoryLocation}s.
 * <p>This became necessary in version 9.7 because starting from there, folders and files could share the same name in
 * the repository (think "test" folder and "test.rmp" on disk, but "test" (folder) and "test" (process) in a Core
 * repository. Call {@link #withLocationType(RepositoryLocationType)} to set the expected return type.</p>
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, it is even now possible that different entry types (say an example set and a process) share the same
 * name (prefix), since on disk it is also perfectly fine to have a "test.rmp" and a "test.rmhdf5table" file in the same
 * location. Call {@link #withExpectedDataEntryType(Class)} to set the expected (sub-)data entry type.
 * </p>

	 *                         first {@link IOObjectEntry} it finds with the given name (aka prefix in this example).
	 *                         Because for historical reasons, {@link RepositoryLocation} only consists of a string
	 *                         which only includes the prefix of such entries, it would be impossible to later determine
