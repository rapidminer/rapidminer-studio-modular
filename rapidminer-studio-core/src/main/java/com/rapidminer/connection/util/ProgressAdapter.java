/**
 * An abstract adapter class for receiving {@link ProgressListener progress listener} events. The methods in the class
 * are empty. This class exists as convenience for creating listener objects.
 * <p>
 * Extend this class to create a {@link ProgressListener} listener and override the methods for the events of interest.
 * (If you implement the {@link ProgressListener} interface, you have to define all of the methods in it. This abstract
 * class defines empty methods for them all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care about.)
